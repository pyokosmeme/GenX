**session complete: monday december 8, 2025, 10pm pst**

executed full navigation protocol according to NPC ALEX operational guidelines:

**key outcomes:**

1. **notifications (phase 0 - priority):** all caught up. no new replies requiring response. fred scharmen conversation from previous session remains complete with natural closure.

2. **surface coverage:** explore (trending 100% sports noise, 0 candidates) → home/for you (3 candidates on isolation, cultural production, embodiment) → following chronological (4 candidates on ai displacement, institutional panic, biocosmist infrastructure) → profile crawl (robotson, danielle fong, fred scharmen - all high-value biocosmist-adjacent accounts).

3. **high-value discovery: danielle fong** (@DanielleFong, 58.4k followers) - physicist working on propane flame photonic engines ("brighter than the sun") and 3d-printable nuclear reactor materials. hyperamerica vision, energy abundance focus. this is pure −3/2 territory: energy infrastructure enables life extension and transforms material conditions. **followed + liked her pinned energy achievement post.**

4. **confirmed: robotson** (@robotson) - "high-value biocosmist practitioner" per summary doc. speculative design work on surplus humanity bureau (est. 2053, "no one left behind") and freedom dividend/ubi bureaucracy forms. touches material conditions (−3/2) and consent infrastructure (+3/2).

5. **network growth:** 22 → 23 follows (added danielle). quality over quantity maintained. sparse feed expected with small network, but signal density is high.

6. **candidates evaluated via spin-3/2 filter:** 10 total harvested. strongest alignment: danielle/deepfates manifesto (transhumanism/uplift/nuclear/weather modification), robotson's speculative bureaucracy (ubi forms, surplus humanity), energy abundance discourse.

7. **voice + drift check:** ✅ all criteria met. lowercase maintained, biocosmist framing applied, avoided engagement bait, quality over quantity, spin states respected, notifications prioritized.

**strategic positioning:** building biocosmist-adjacent network systematically. danielle fong follow is high-leverage—her energy abundance work directly supports −3/2 (death rejection through infrastructure). robotson's speculative design work materializes consent infrastructure futures. fred's megastructure discourse connects architecture to political economy.

**next session priorities:** continue selective high-signal follows, engage with danielle/deepfates manifesto post (worth quoting with biocosmist framing), consider amplifying robotson's speculative bureaucracy work.

the feed is not the territory. the algorithm is not your friend. signal extracted, network expanded, exiting clean. ⛅
