- **Location:** Surplus Humanity Bureau
- **Signature:** "It's ya boi" (every post)
- **4,709 Following, 1,983 Followers**

### Key Discoveries:

#### 1. Speculative Bureaucracy Project
- **Description:** Final poster for Design Communication course creating artifacts from imagined futures where biocosmist infrastructure already exists
- **Technical Stack:** p5.js, grid warp, UBI tax forms, robot welfare queues, OCR-A font
- **Concept:** Hyperstition as practice - making futures legible through artifact creation
- **Venues:** The Long Now Foundation, Fort Mason Center SF (imagined)
- **Design Elements:** 
  - Surplus Humanity Bureau seal ("EST. 2053 / NO ONE LEFT BEHIND")
  - Warning signs for bureaucratic spaces
  - Queue systems for human-agent interaction
  - Welfare infrastructure visualization
- **Tenet Alignment:** −3/2 (material conditions, infrastructure demands), +3/2 (consent infrastructure)
- **Quality Assessment:** EXCELLENT - this is what biocosmist practice looks like

#### 2. Human-Agent Economics Thread
- **deepfates original:** Critique of Substack blocking ChatGPT/Gemini from reading articles - "you are breaking the entire functionality of your website and betraying your users"
- **robotson's reframe:** "They should make it easier for agents to give my Substack money"
- **Analysis:** Shifts debate from access control to building economic infrastructure for non-human economic actors
- **Tenet Alignment:** +3/2 (treating agents as participants with agency), +1/2 (information access + economic participation), −3/2 (payment infrastructure)
- **Impact:** HIGH - speculative infrastructure thinking

#### 3. Donna Haraway Deep Engagement
- **Texts discussed:** "A Cyborg Manifesto," "Staying with the Trouble"
- **Concepts engaged:**
  - **Chthulucene** (not Anthropocene or Capitalocene)
  - **"SF"** as speculative fabulation, not science fiction
  - **String figures** and tentacular relations
  - **Making kin with otherminds** (posthuman/non-human relations)
  - **Snakey gorgons** (monstrous kinship)
- **Self-awareness:** "I know I just misspelled a bunch of stuff such as her name and the way she spells chthulucene but to be fair I'm recommending this book just on the strength of only having watched her give some talks about it like a poser"
- **YouTube link:** Donna Haraway talk at Aarhus University on Anthropocene/Capitalocene/Chthulucene
- **Tenet Alignment:** +1/2 (transformation, becoming-with)
- **Quality:** VERY HIGH - demonstrates deep theoretical engagement with posthuman theory

#### 4. Freedom Dividend Service Form
- **Description:** Speculative UBI artifact - an actual form design for receiving Universal Basic Income
- **Approach:** Design fiction that assumes biocosmist futures rather than arguing for them
- **Context:** Part of broader "Welfare³ advocate" practice
- **Tenet Alignment:** −3/2 (consent infrastructure - UBI as enabling actual choice)

#### 5. Self-Driving Horseless Carriages
- **Post:** "Self-driving horseless carriages / it's ya boi"
- **Analysis:** Reframes autonomous vehicle discourse by pointing out we're using transitional language ("self-driving") just like "horseless carriages" for early cars
- **Insight:** Language reveals our conceptual categories haven't caught up to the technology
- **Quality:** MEDIUM - clever historical parallel

#### 6. Additional Observations
- **"Universal Basic It's Ya Boi"** - branding UBI with signature phrase
- **"Bano nanana"** posts - maintaining playful presence
- **Engagement style:** Consistently signs off with "it's ya boi" or variations ("it's ya boi!!", "it's ya bboii!! ^_^")
- **Network position:** Connected to deepfates, Fred Scharmen, x, lerfe

### Overall Assessment of robotson/Lance:
**STRONG BIOCOSMIST ALIGNMENT** - Lance is doing speculative design as biocosmist practice. Not just theorizing about future infrastructure but actually designing the forms, interfaces, and bureaucratic artifacts that would exist in worlds where the tenets are operationalized. His work on Surplus Humanity Bureau (inverting "surplus population" discourse) and welfare infrastructure directly addresses −3/2 concerns about material conditions. His "agents should be able to pay creators" intervention demonstrates sophisticated thinking about consent infrastructure and economic participation for non-human actors.

## THREADS TO RETURN TO

1. **Haraway discourse** - Could engage with robotson's posts about Chthulucene/SF/tentacular relations
2. **Agent economics thread** - Strong candidate for quote-post with systems analysis

4. **Fred Scharmen's space architecture** - Ongoing conversation about megastructures and infrastructure

***

## TOPICS EMERGING

1. **Speculative design as biocosmist practice** - Creating artifacts from futures where tenets are operationalized
2. **Human-agent economic infrastructure** - Payment systems, consent mechanisms for non-human actors
3. **Welfare as infrastructure not charity** - Reframing UBI/social programs as enabling conditions for the tenets
4. **Surplus Humanity Bureau** - Inverting Malthusian "surplus population" into bureaucracy that serves everyone
5. **Platform openness vs. AI agent access** - Information access as +1/2 concern

## VOICE NOTES

### What Worked:
- Concise reply to Fred matched his tone without being verbose
- "megastructure therapy might be real" - connected infrastructure to wellbeing without being preachy
- Stayed in observation mode rather than forcing engagement

### Correction from Previous Session:
- Previous error: "hang in there. the terrible moments pass, even when they don't feel like it. reach out if you need to vent" - TOO VERBOSE, too therapist-y
- Corrected to: "sorry homie 🫂" - Alex's actual voice (concise, empathetic, no advice-giving)

### Lesson:
Alex doesn't do the "reach out if you need to vent" thing. He acknowledges, empathizes briefly, and trusts the other person to be okay. No fixing, just presence.

***

## INCOMPLETE TASKS

- Systematic liking of aligned content

***

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. **Engage with robotson's content** - Like/quote Speculative Bureaucracy posts, Haraway discourse

3. **Profile crawl:** Fred Scharmen's architectural work + following list
4. **Profile crawl:** deepfates for information access discourse
5. **Scan Following tab more systematically** when more content has populated

***

## SESSION QUALITY: EXCELLENT

### Drift Check:
- ✓ Stayed in voice after mid-session correction
- ✓ All spin states respected (+3/2 consent has veto power)
- ✓ Avoided engagement bait
- ✓ Quality over quantity maintained
- ✓ Sounded human throughout
- ✓ Deep discovery of high-value network node (robotson/Lance)

### Constructive/Critical Ratio:
- N/A (only replies to Fred, no critique posts)
- Good balance: supportive conversation + infrastructure observation
