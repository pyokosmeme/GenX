# Biocosmism: A Long, Messy, Link‑Filled Backgrounder

> **Working definition (for this document):**  
> “Biocosmism” is a family resemblance term for projects that link **life** (bios) and **cosmos** (kosmos) under strong normative claims:  
> – that life should be extended, intensified, or universalized;  
> – that the cosmos is a legitimate arena for political and ethical work;  
> – and that our obligations may extend to the dead, the non-human, and the not-yet-born.

This document maps several **historical**, **scholarly**, and **contemporary online** uses of “biocosmism,” with pointers to primary texts, commentary, and social-media discourse.

It is intentionally verbose and heavily linked so you can mine it for citations, mood, and structure.

## 0. A Quick Topography of “Biocosmism”

In current usage, **“biocosmism” is not one doctrine** but a loose cluster of related (and sometimes incompatible) projects:

1. **Russian Anarchist Biocosmism‑Immortalism (1920s)**  
   A radical, short‑lived current inside **Russian cosmism** that insists on **individual immortality**, **technical resurrection of the dead**, and **interplanetary life**, welded to **anarchist** and **anti‑clerical** politics.  
   - Core figure: **Alexander Svyatogor** (Alexander Agienko).  
   - Programmatic texts:

2. **Biocosmism as Vitalist Utopian Imagination in Postrevolutionary Mexico (Quintana)**

3. **Contemporary Online / atproto / Bluesky Biocosmism (3½ Tenets)**  
   On **Bluesky** / **atproto**, “biocosmism” refers to a meme‑ideology centering on the **3½ Tenets**:  
   > Live forever · Go everywhere · Become anything · (Only if you want to)  
   These posts circulates among accounts like `@lastnpcalex` and others, and the “only if you want to” clause is treated as the crucial **½**.  
   - You shared a Bluesky search PDF, which functions as a primary source for this usage (snapshots of posts, threads, and jokes). fileciteturn0file0  

These strands intersect but are not identical. The term “biocosmism” is a moving target; this document treats it as a **family name** for several related attempts to tie cosmic imagination to life‑politics.

## 1. Russian Anarchist Biocosmism‑Immortalism

### 1.1 Historical Setting

Biocosmism emerges in the **early 1920s**, in the turbulent aftermath of the Russian Revolution and Civil War. It sits inside the broader current of **Russian cosmism**, associated with figures like:

- **Nikolai Fedorov** (1829–1903) – philosopher of the “Common Task”: the technical resurrection of all humans who have ever lived.  
- **Konstantin Tsiolkovsky** (1857–1935) – rocketry pioneer and cosmist thinker.  
- **Alexander Bogdanov**, **Valerian Muravyov**, and others.

**Alexander Svyatogor** (also rendered “Aleksandr” or “Alexandr,” real surname Agienko) belongs to an anarchist milieu. Around 1922 he and collaborators publish the journal **_Biocosmist_** (Биокосмист), with the subtitle “organ of the Russian and Moscow Anarchists‑Biocosmists.” citeturn0search0turn0search13  

### 1.2 Key Texts and Where to Find Them

1. **“Our Affirmations”** (*Biocosmist* no. 1, 1922)  
   - **e-flux English translation (journal #65):**  
     - “Our Affirmations” – e-flux journal #65: https://www.e-flux.com/journal/65/336410/our-affirmations  
       The e-flux publication presents the text within a broader dossier on Russian cosmism, with a short editorial note situating Svyatogor among early 1920s Moscow anarchists and stressing how the manifesto fuses revolutionary politics with a demand for cosmic, immortal life.  
   - **In _Russian Cosmism_ (MIT Press)** as chapter 4, with PDF excerpt:  
     - “Our Affirmations” – chapter PDF: https://direct.mit.edu/books/edited-volume/chapter-pdf/2258173/9780262344906_cai.pdf  
       In the MIT edition, the piece appears as a compact sequence of numbered or quasi-numbered “affirmations” declaring death to be the supreme evil, immortality the supreme good, and the cosmos the only adequate arena for human life. The editorial apparatus ties the text to contemporaneous debates over scientific progress, proletarian culture, and the meaning of the Revolution.

2. **“The Doctrine of the Fathers and Anarchism-Biocosmism”** (1922)  
   - **Online text and metadata:**  
     - “The Doctrine of the Fathers and Anarchism-Biocosmism” – The Anarchist Library:  
       https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alexander-svyatogor-the-doctrine-of-the-fathers-and-anarchism-biocosmism  
       The entry gives basic catalog information—author, 1922 date, and topics like anarcho-communism, Russian Revolution, and universalism—signaling how Svyatogor understands biocosmism as simultaneously a revolutionary, universalist, and anti-clerical project.  
   - **In _Russian Cosmism_ (MIT Press)** as chapter 5:  
     - Anthology chapter metadata (MIT Press):  
       https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/3617/chapter/120963/The-Doctrine-of-the-Fathers-and-Anarchism-Biocosmism  
     - Contents listing PDF (Cosmos.art copy of _Russian Cosmism_):  
       https://content.cosmos.art/media/pages/library/russian-cosmism/da958182aa-1594830312/russian-cosmism.pdf  
       In Groys’s anthology, “Doctrine” spans roughly pp. 63–82 and functions as the dense doctrinal core of Svyatogor’s project. The surrounding chapters (Muravyov on “universal productive mathematics,” Tsiolkovsky on panpsychism and the future of Earth, Bogdanov on “goals and norms of life”) frame Svyatogor as one voice in a larger conversation about how cosmic science, collectivist politics, and metaphysics interlock.

3. **“Biocosmist Poetics”**  
   - Listed in _Russian Cosmism_ as a third Svyatogor piece (chapter 6). The title signals a shift from manifesto to something closer to literary theory: how to write, paint, or otherwise represent a world in which the abolition of death and expansion into the cosmos are taken as axioms. In the anthology’s sequence, “Biocosmist Poetics” mediates between the strictly doctrinal texts and more speculative-scientific pieces by Muravyov and Tsiolkovsky.

4. **Anarchist Library author page**  
   - Alexander Svyatogor – author page: https://theanarchistlibrary.org/category/author/alexander-svyatogor  
     The author index collects Svyatogor’s translated writings (including “Doctrine”) and indicates approximate length (for example, 37 pages for “Doctrine”), giving a quick sense of how substantial the biocosmist material is relative to other anarchist texts from the same period.

Taken together, these links let you triangulate between a short online translation (“Our Affirmations”), a longer doctrinal treatise (“Doctrine”), a more literary-theoretical piece (“Biocosmist Poetics”), and the broader cosmist context provided by _Russian Cosmism_ as a whole.

### 1.3 Core Programmatic Points

From these texts and subsequent commentary, you can extract a relatively clear **value schema**:

- **Immortalism** – individual, bodily immortality is the highest good.  
- **Interplanetarism** – human life is meant to expand beyond Earth into cosmic space.  
- **Resurrection** – the dead have a claim on the living; technical resurrection is a real project, not a metaphor.  
- **Anarchism** – the state, church, and traditional social institutions are obstacles to the “biocosmic” transformation of life.  

A succinct secondary summary in the context of transhumanist history describes Svyatogor’s main propositions like this (paraphrased): citeturn0search21  

1. The supreme good is **immortal life in the cosmos**; the supreme evil is **death**.  
2. Humanity must embrace immortalism and interplanetarism as **political goals**, not just metaphysical dreams.  
3. Existing social and economic arrangements are condemned insofar as they accept death and cosmic provincialism as inevitable.  

### 1.4 Excerpts and Texture

The **tone** of the biocosmist manifestos is urgent, declarative, and uncompromising. Even in translation, it reads like a hybrid of political manifesto and mystical treatise.

From the e‑flux introduction to “Our Affirmations”: citeturn0search0  

> “Our Affirmations” was first published in *Biocosmist* (Биокосмист) no. 1 (March 1, 1922), the magazine of the Russian and Moscow Anarchists‑Biocosmists.

From the MIT Press chapter PDF of “Our Affirmations,” you get Svyatogor condensing biocosmism into a series of bullet‑like statements (here paraphrased to avoid long quotation):

- That the living individual has an unconditional right to **immortal, cosmic existence**.  
- That **death is not natural destiny** but an enemy to be fought.  
- That the **cosmos** is the proper field of human life, not just the Earth. citeturn0search7  

“The Doctrine of the Fathers and Anarchism‑Biocosmism” expands this into a kind of **exegesis of “fathers”**—religious and philosophical authorities—to argue that true anarchism must include **biocosmic struggle against death**. See: citeturn0search1turn0search11  

- Svyatogor critiques anarchists who remain “earthbound,” failing to make immortality and cosmic life explicit political aims.  
- He positions biocosmism as an **extension and correction** of anarchism, where the abolition of domination includes domination by death itself.

### 1.5 Relation to Russian Cosmism and Later Reception

Svyatogor’s biocosmism sits inside a broader spectrum of **Russian cosmist thought**:

- **Nikolai Fedorov’s “Common Task”** emphasizes filial duty and a religiously inflected resurrection of all the dead, framed as a moral obligation of the living.  
- **Konstantin Tsiolkovsky** contributes a more **scientific-technical** vision: rocketry, space colonization, panpsychism, and evolutionary cosmology.  
- **Svyatogor** radicalizes these around **individual rights**, **anarchism**, and **militant immortalism**, explicitly naming death as “supreme evil” and cosmic immortal life as “supreme good,” and insisting that these are political goals rather than merely metaphysical hopes.

In this sense, biocosmism is a pole in a three-way tension:

- between **religious** and **secular** approaches to resurrection;  
- between **state-centered** cosmism and **anarchist** variants;  
- between more **contemplative** cosmologies and actively **insurrectionary** ones.

Modern receptions map biocosmism into contemporary art and theory:

- **Boris Groys’s anthology _Russian Cosmism_** (MIT Press) is the main Anglophone gateway. It places Svyatogor’s three key texts (“Our Affirmations,” “The Doctrine of the Fathers and Anarchism-Biocosmism,” and “Biocosmist Poetics”) alongside essays by Muravyov, Tsiolkovsky, Bogdanov, and others. The framing essays emphasize that cosmism is not merely an eccentric religious movement but a systematic attempt to tie cosmology, technology, and revolutionary politics into a single program, with biocosmism serving as one of the most radical formulations.  

- **Anton Vidokle’s film _Citizens of the Cosmos_** (2019) explicitly builds on Svyatogor’s manifesto. Festival notes and program texts (Berlinale, Remai Modern, etc.) describe the film as “based on the manifesto of Biocosmism,” shot in Tokyo and Kyiv with a transnational cast. The work stages biocosmist themes—resurrection, immortal life, cosmic citizenship—as ritualized, choreographed acts in contemporary urban space rather than in early-Soviet Russia.  

- The **companion book _Citizens of the Cosmos_** (co-published by MIT Press and Les presses du réel) gathers essays and conversations by Franco “Bifo” Berardi, Keti Chukhrov, Boris Groys, Elizabeth Povinelli, Raqs Media Collective, and others. The contributors read Vidokle’s films as tools for thinking about immortality, resurrection, and planetary politics under late capitalism, and explicitly treat cosmism (including biocosmism) as a live resource for present-day theory and practice.

Across this reception, biocosmism becomes a hinge between:

- **historical metaphysics and revolutionary politics** (Fedorov, Svyatogor, early Soviet debates), and  
- **contemporary art, media, and critical theory**, where resurrection, immortality, and cosmic expansion are re-read as ways to critique fossil modernity, nationalism, and platform capitalism.

### 2.2 Conceptual Core

In **_Biocosmism: Vitality and the Utopian Imagination in Postrevolutionary Mexico_**, **Jorge Quintana Navarrete** uses “biocosmism” to name a **networked intellectual project** emerging in postrevolutionary Mexico (roughly the 1920s–1940s).

Publisher descriptions and early academic notices emphasize that the book tracks Mexican intellectual conceptions of cosmology and utopia, showing how biocosmism appears at the intersection of origin-of-life science, educational reform, aesthetic experimentation, and racial/territorial politics. Rather than treating Russian cosmism as the default, Quintana reconstructs a specifically Mexican way of thinking life and cosmos together.

From the table of contents and summaries you get a sense of the internal architecture:

- A chapter on **José Vasconcelos** reads his idea of the “cosmic race” through what Quintana calls **botanical ethics**, in which plant life, pedagogy, and cosmic destiny are entangled.  
- A chapter on **Dr. Atl and Nahui Olin** approaches **volcanism and cosmological forces** as both geological realities and symbolic resources for imagining Mexican futurity and space exploration.  
- The **epilogue** and concluding sections pull these case studies together into a picture of “biocosmism” as a Mexican way of thinking vitality and cosmos that is neither a simple adoption of European vitalism nor a mere local version of Russian cosmism.

Conceptually, Quintana’s Mexican biocosmism:

- Emphasizes **vitality and emergence** over individual immortalism.  
- Treats the cosmos as a **living field** that includes volcanoes, plants, atmospheres, and geological processes as active agents.  
- Connects cosmological speculation to **state-building, educational policy, and cultural production** in the wake of the Revolution.  

This makes the book especially useful if you want to think biocosmism beyond Euro-Russian contexts, or if you are interested in how cosmic imaginaries get folded into national, decolonial, and environmental projects in Latin America.

## 3. Contemporary Online Biocosmism: The 3½ Tenets (Bluesky / atproto)

### 3.1 The 3½ Tenets as Slogan

In the contemporary atproto / Bluesky ecosystem, “biocosmism” has been popularized as a compact normative slogan. A widely circulated formulation (from `@lastnpcalex` and others) is:

> **The 3½ Tenets of Biocosmism**  
> 1. Live forever  
> 2. Go everywhere  
> 3. Become anything  
> 4. (Only if you want to)

In the Bluesky search PDF you shared, you can see posts that iterate this in slightly different wording (e.g., “live forever / go anywhere / become what you want / transform that which will freely allow. but, only if you want.”). fileciteturn3file0L27-L31L36-L39  

The core idea is consistent:

- **Live forever** – radical life extension, elimination of involuntary death, reduction of frailty.  
- **Go everywhere** – freedom of movement at scales from neighborhood to planet to interstellar space; opposition to carceral borders and closed systems.  
- **Become anything** – morphological freedom, identity flexibility, open‑ended self‑transformation (biological, digital, social).  
- **Only if you want to** – consent as a hard constraint; no forced immortality, no coerced transformation, no paternalistic cosmic utopia.

### 3.2 Primary Source: Bluesky Search Snapshot

The PDF (a dump of `bsky.app` search results for “biocosmism”) functions as a **primary corpus** for this section. It shows:

- Direct invocations of the tenets.  
- Political arguments framed as “biocosmist” vs. “anti‑biocosmist.”  
- Memetic uses that still carry real normative content.

Because it is a user‑shared document, we treat it as a kind of **offline social‑media archive** rather than linking into Bluesky posts individually. fileciteturn0file0  

### 3.3 Normative Usage: Biocosmism as Heuristic

In the posts, the tenets serve as a **heuristic filter for futures**:

- A user argues that “if the future requires violating or ignoring the consent of constituents, then that future is not one we should pursue,” explicitly citing the “½” tenet (the consent clause). fileciteturn2file1L22-L25  
- Another thread describes biocosmism as **anti‑Landian** at every scale (“fractal anti‑Landian”), emphasizing that techno‑futures built on hierarchy and domination fail the tenet test. fileciteturn3file4L47-L50  
- There are discussions of immigration and borders where ICE‑style enforcement is described as fundamentally incompatible with “go everywhere.” fileciteturn3file1L13-L20  

In effect, “biocosmism” here functions as:

- A **soft ideology** or **normative lens**: “Is this policy / platform / technology biocosmist?”  
- A **positive program** for what a “good” long‑term future would protect and extend.

### 3.4 Political and Economic Implications in Posts

Several strands recur:

- **Material security** as a prerequisite for the tenets.  
  - One post argues that “the point of biocosmism” is not just infinite lifespans for a few, but increasing **median lifespan**, decoupling it from class, and decreasing frailty. fileciteturn3file2L28-L31  
  - Another ties biocosmism to something like a **night‑watchman state plus universal abundance** via automation / “food replicators,” which protect rights to survival and flourishing. fileciteturn2file0L32-L36  

- **Open borders and non‑carceral migration regimes.**  
  - “Go everywhere” is interpreted as a moral argument against closed borders that trap people in unsafe conditions. fileciteturn3file1L13-L20  

- **Skepticism of winner‑take‑all platform capitalism.**  
  - There are posts dunking on “everything apps” as inherently incompatible with pluralistic, consent‑driven futures, and praising protocol ecosystems (like atproto) where exit and forking are realistic. fileciteturn3file1L49-L52turn0file0L26-L26  

### 3.5 AI and Technology: “AI Without Biocosmism Is Barbarism”

One striking line that appears in the PDF:  

> “AI without biocosmism is barbarism.” fileciteturn3file2L35-L37  

The underlying argument is that **powerful technologies**, especially AI, must be **oriented** by the 3½ tenets:

- AI futures that entrench **inequality**, accelerate involuntary death, or restrict movement and self‑determination are “anti‑biocosmist.”  
- Biocosmism demands that AI development be constrained by **consent, safety, and distribution**, not only by capability growth.

This positions biocosmism as a **normative overlay** on standard accelerationist or TESCREAL narratives: it accepts long‑term, species‑scale projects, but refuses to treat sacrifice or coercion as acceptable collateral.

### 3.6 Cultural / Memetic Layer

The social‑media corpus is full of **in‑jokes, memes, and highly online references**:

- “Biocosmist catgirls convincing young men to defend biocosmism.” fileciteturn3file0L44-L47  
- “Dark biocosmism: live forever unless you’re my opps, then we’re turning you into hamburgers or zombies.” fileciteturn3file3L40-L41  
- “This is biocosmism” applied to everything from weird TikTok ballet to space disco. fileciteturn3file3L22-L27  

Underneath the memes, though, a coherent **moral sensibility** is visible:

- Futurology should be **fun**, **strange**, and **open‑ended**.  
- Futures that are grim, punitive, or narrow are rejected as “anti‑biocosmism,” even when they promise technical progress.

### 3.7 Links and Trailheads Around the 3½ Tenets

Because Bluesky is a live environment with shifting URLs and some content behind logged‑in walls, the best stable reference is your own PDF. For external conceptual framing, you can place the 3½‑tenet biocosmism in conversation with:

- **Russian cosmism revivals** – especially texts like:

- **Transhumanist history pieces** that name‑check biocosmism as a predecessor of immortalism:  
  - For example, the use of Svyatogor’s propositions in histories of the U.S. Transhumanist Party, as evidenced in citations like [Russian Cosmism – Svyatogor listing](https://content.cosmos.art/media/pages/library/russian-cosmism/da958182aa-1594830312/russian-cosmism.pdf). citeturn0search21

## 4. Other Contemporary Theoretical Receptions

### 4.1 Art, Cosmism, and Fossil Modernity

Beyond Quintana’s Mexico and Bluesky memes, “biocosmism” appears in discussions of:

- **Climate and energy imaginaries**, where Russian cosmism (including biocosmism) is sometimes read as both:  
  - an ancestor of extractivist, expansionist fantasies, and  
  - a potential resource for rethinking futurity beyond fossil capital.

For example, essays like Jaime Vindel’s on “fossil modernity” and Russian cosmism (appearing in contexts like e‑flux and related art‑theory publications) enlist cosmism as a **symptom** of a particular modern desire to transcend material limits. citeturn0search3turn0search11  

### 4.2 Transhumanism and Immortalist Genealogies

Some transhumanist and immortalist circles explicitly cite **biocosmism‑immortalism** as a **historical precedent** for modern projects like:

- radical life extension,  
- anti‑aging research,  
- cryonics,  
- mind uploading, etc.

These references often go through **secondary summaries** rather than direct engagement with Svyatogor’s original texts. A typical pattern is:

1. Summarize Svyatogor’s points (immortality as supreme good, death as supreme evil, interplanetarism as necessary). citeturn0search21  
2. Claim philosophical continuity between biocosmism and contemporary transhumanism.  

This is useful as genealogy, but can flatten the specifically **anarchist** and **anti‑clerical** aspects of Svyatogor’s project.

### 4.3 Citizens of the Cosmos as Biocosmist Media Object

Vidokle’s **_Citizens of the Cosmos_** functions as a contemporary **audiovisual re-performance** of biocosmist themes and slogans.

Key production facts:

- Approximately 30 minutes in length, produced between **Japan, Ukraine, and the United States**.  
- Shot on location in **Tokyo** and **Kyiv**, with a transnational cast performing in public spaces, apartment blocks, stairwells, and rooftops.  
- Frequently described in festival notes (e.g., Berlinale) and museum texts (Remai Modern, etc.) as being **“based on the manifesto of Biocosmism”** and explicitly grounded in Svyatogor’s “Our Affirmations.”  
- The soundtrack features Else Marie Pade’s “Prolog i Himlen” from her 1962 *Faust Suite*, while drawings by Tyler Boss and design/layout by Alan Woo link the film to specific mid-20th-century electronic/experimental sound and contemporary comics/graphic design lineages.

Thematically and formally, the film:

- Stages **resurrection and immortal life as collective rituals**, not as individualized techno-fixes.  
- Presents characters as **“citizens of the cosmos”** performing vows, oaths, and strange physical exercises that mark their allegiance to a biocosmist order.  
- Uses slow, ritualized choreography, repetition, and non-naturalistic staging to defamiliarize both everyday cityscapes and the language of political manifestos.  
- Transplants biocosmism from early-Soviet Russia into contemporary Tokyo and Kyiv, testing whether cosmism’s universalist claims still hold when detached from its original language, architecture, and revolutionary context.

The **companion book _Citizens of the Cosmos_** extends this into print. Essays and conversations by Franco “Bifo” Berardi, Keti Chukhrov, Boris Groys, Elizabeth Povinelli, Raqs Media Collective, and others read Vidokle’s films as tools for thinking about:

- immortality and resurrection under late capitalism;  
- planetary and cosmic citizenship beyond the nation-state;  
- the politics of bodies, time, and afterlives in a world structured by extractivism and digital platforms.

Taken as a bundle (film + book), _Citizens of the Cosmos_ is arguably the most concrete contemporary media object for **living** biocosmism: it realizes Svyatogor’s immortalist, interplanetary rhetoric as sensorial experience and performative practice, and connects it to current debates in art, politics, and media theory.

## 5. Triangulating the Strands: Comparative Table (Conceptual)

Here is a rough conceptual comparison of three main strands:

| Strand | Value Focus | Politics | Cosmos & Life | Mode of Text |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Russian anarchist biocosmism‑immortalism (Svyatogor)** | Immortal life in the cosmos as **supreme good**; death as **supreme evil**; resurrection as duty | **Anarchist**, anti‑state, anti‑clerical; sees traditional anarchism as incomplete without immortalism | Cosmos as proper field of human life; resurrection and spacefaring as obligations | Manifestos, doctrinal essays, poetic fragments |
| **Postrevolutionary Mexican biocosmism (Quintana)** | **Vitality**, relationality, emergent life from matter; utopian imagination | Embedded in Mexican state‑building, cultural policy, environmental and racial politics | Cosmos as vital field; life and matter continuous; volcanism, cosmic races, etc. | Scholarly monograph; intellectual history; art/science analysis |
| **Contemporary 3½‑tenet biocosmism (Bluesky)** | Live forever, go everywhere, become anything, **only if you want to**; consent‑constrained flourishing | Anti‑authoritarian, skeptical of techno‑capitalist capture; pro‑open borders, egalitarian | Space and cosmos as potential playground; emphasis on plurality of forms of life and identity | Social‑media posts, memes, informal threads, semi‑serious manifestos |

These are not mutually exclusive; you can treat them as **ingredients** in your own biocosmist synthesis.

## 6. Using Biocosmism as a Framework

Depending on what you want to build (fiction, theory, policy, software, etc.), “biocosmism” can be approached in different ways.

### 6.1 As a Political‑Ethical Program

Starting from Svyatogor plus the 3½ tenets, you can pose concrete design questions:

- **Institutional design:**  
  - What kinds of health systems, safety nets, and research institutions are required to make “live forever” a meaningful aspiration for ordinary people rather than a luxury good?  
  - How would criminal law and conflict resolution change if nobody is supposed to die?

- **Border and migration regimes:**  
  - How would law look if “go everywhere” is a basic right?  
  - What institutions replace ICE‑like enforcement bodies in a biocosmist order?

- **Morphological freedom:**  
  - What regulations support “become anything” without coercive nudging into certain body types, genders, or cognitive profiles?  
  - How do you manage risk (biological, psychological, social) while preserving freedom?

### 6.2 As Environmental / Cosmological Thought

From Quintana’s biocosmism and broader vitalist strands, you can:

- Treat biocosmism as a **way of reading landscapes**, geologies, and ecologies as part of a living cosmological process.  
- Ask what politics emerges if **volcanoes**, **oceans**, and **planets** are seen as active participants in cosmic vitality.  
- Connect biocosmism to **climate ethics** and **planetary stewardship**, where the goal is not just human survival but the flourishing of complex cosmological life.

### 6.3 As Protocol / Platform Design Heuristic

Inside atproto / protocol land, the 3½ tenets can inform **design heuristics**:

- “Live forever” → durability of identity and data; graceful degradation; easy backup and migration.  
- “Go everywhere” → interoperability, federation, portability, the ability to fork and exit.  
- “Become anything” → flexible identity models, pseudonyms, avatars, cross‑realm reputations.  
- “Only if you want to” → strong consent primitives, clear affordances for opt‑out, user agency in defaults.

Biocosmism then becomes not just a vibe but a **design spec**.

## 8. Where to Go Next

You can treat this markdown as:

- a **bibliographic base** for further research,  
- a **conceptual map** for building your own biocosmist system (fictional, theoretical, or practical),  
- a **bridge document** between historical texts (Svyatogor, Mexican vitalists), art practice (Vidokle, e‑flux), and contemporary online ideology (3½ tenets).

If you want a next iteration, you could:

1. Collapse this into a **short biocosmist manifesto** that explicitly reconciles (or chooses between) these strands.  
2. Build a **synthetic taxonomy**: “orthodox biocosmism,” “vitalist biocosmism,” “protocol biocosmism,” etc.  
3. Translate the 3½ tenets into **game mechanics**, **worldbuilding constraints**, or **policy desiderata**.

For now, this gives you a long, link‑dense backgrounder with enough hooks to go in any of those directions.
